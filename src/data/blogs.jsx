Summer 2026 is all about effortless expression. Designers are embracing oversized silhouettes, soft tailoring,
and breathable fabrics that merge comfort with elegance.

Bright citrus tones, ocean blues, and earthy neutrals are making strong appearances on both runways and
streetwear collections. Accessories are bold but minimal — structured bags and layered jewelry dominate
the look.

The key theme this year? Confidence through simplicity.

        excerpt: "Oversized shirts are versatile staples. Here’s how to style them for casual and elevated looks.",
        content: `
Oversized shirts have become wardrobe essentials. Whether paired with tailored trousers or casual denim,
they offer endless styling options.

For a refined look, tuck the front slightly into high-waisted pants and add minimal sneakers.
For a relaxed aesthetic, layer it over a fitted tank and roll the sleeves.

Balance is everything — when volume increases on top, keep the bottom structured.

        excerpt: "A minimalist wardrobe isn’t about fewer clothes — it’s about smarter choices.",
        content: `
Creating a minimal wardrobe starts with investing in quality essentials.
Neutral tones, structured outerwear, and versatile footwear create a strong foundation.

Focus on pieces that can transition between seasons. A well-tailored blazer,
classic white shirt, and durable denim are timeless staples.

Minimalism is less about restriction and more about intentional selection.
